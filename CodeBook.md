# CodeBook - Exploratory Data Analysis Project 1 #

## Introduction ##
This markdown file is intended to  document source data, any transformations on the data and final data sets used by plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R and plot4.R. For documentation on my plot scripts use this link [README](https://github.com/KonecnyA/GACD-Final-Project/blob/master/README.md) .

## Source Information, Data, License & Citation ##

- Source of data [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/)
  
- Data set [Electric power consumption](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip), 20Mb

- **Study Description** - Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.

## household\_power\_consumption.zip ##
The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the [UCI web site](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption):

1.Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy

2.Time: time in format hh:mm:ss

3.Global\_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)

4.Global\_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)

5.Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)

6.Global\_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)

7.Sub\_metering\_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).

8.Sub\_metering\_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.

9.Sub\_metering\_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
 


## Loading the data ##
When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:

- The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before reading into R. Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be fine).
- We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
- You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time classes in R using the "strptime()"  and "as.Date()" functions.
- Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.

## Structure of Data##
There is a set of test files (subject, X and y) and train files (subject, X and y).  I am assuming that when loaded they are in the correct order to merge. The subject file has a subject\_id(int) for every single row (observation). The y file has an activity(Factor) for every single row (observation).  The X file has all the feature measurements (561 num) for every single row (observation).  When the columns are merged together then the result has subject\_id, activity and 561 feature measurements.
